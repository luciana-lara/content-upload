## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using media.thepom.app ("the Service," "we," "us," or "our"), operated by Intelligent Iterations ("the Company"), you ("you," "your," or "User") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Service.

If you are using the Service on behalf of a business or entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and "you" refers to both you individually and the entity.

## 2. Description of Service

media.thepom.app is a web-based content creation and publishing platform that enables users to:

- **Create content for TikTok**: Upload photo carousels and videos directly to TikTok via the TikTok Content Posting API.
- **Generate content ideas**: Receive AI-powered content suggestions based on analysis of your own website content, using your own OpenAI API key.
- **Manage media**: Temporarily store and manage photos and videos for the purpose of publishing to TikTok.

The Service acts as an intermediary between you and third-party platforms, including TikTok and OpenAI. Your use of those platforms is additionally governed by their respective terms and policies.

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. If you are under 18, you may not create an account or use the Service.

## 4. Account Registration

To access certain features, you must authenticate via TikTok OAuth. By doing so, you authorize us to access your TikTok account information as permitted by the scopes you approve (including basic user information and the ability to publish content on your behalf). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.

## 5. User Content and Ownership

### 5.1 Your Content

You retain full ownership of all content you upload, create, or publish through the Service ("User Content"). By using the Service, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, temporary license to store, process, and transmit your User Content solely for the purpose of providing the Service — specifically, to facilitate the upload and publication of your content to TikTok.

### 5.2 Content Responsibility

You are solely responsible for all User Content you upload, publish, or otherwise make available through the Service. You represent and warrant that:

- You own or have the necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to use and authorize us to use your User Content.
- Your User Content does not infringe or violate the intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other rights of any third party.
- Your User Content complies with TikTok's Community Guidelines, Terms of Service, and all applicable laws and regulations.

- Contains malware, viruses, or any other harmful code.
- Violates TikTok's Community Guidelines or Terms of Service.
- Is deceptive, misleading, or constitutes fraud.
- Exploits or harms minors in any way.

## 6. Temporary Media Storage

### 6.1 Firebase Storage

To facilitate photo carousel uploads to TikTok, User Content (specifically, images) is temporarily stored on our servers via Google Firebase Storage. This is a technical requirement of TikTok's Content Posting API, which requires content to be accessible via a URL during the upload process.

### 6.2 Retention and Deletion

- Images uploaded for TikTok posting are stored temporarily for the sole purpose of completing the TikTok upload process.
- All uploaded media is automatically and permanently deleted from our servers immediately after successful publication to TikTok.
- If a TikTok upload fails, the associated media will be automatically deleted within **24 hours** of the failed attempt.

### 6.3 No Guarantee of Storage

The Service is not a file storage or backup service. We do not guarantee the availability, integrity, or recoverability of any User Content stored on our servers. You are solely responsible for maintaining your own copies of all content.

## 7. Third-Party API Keys

### 7.1 OpenAI API Key

The Service allows you to provide your own OpenAI API key for AI-powered content suggestion features. By providing your API key:

- You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any costs, usage charges, or overages incurred through OpenAI as a result of using the Service.
- You represent that you have the right to use the API key and that your use complies with OpenAI's Terms of Use.
- We will use your API key solely for the purpose of generating content suggestions on your behalf within the Service. We will not store, share, sell, or use your API key for any other purpose.
- You are responsible for revoking or rotating your API key if you believe it has been compromised.

### 7.2 Security of API Keys

While we implement reasonable security measures, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You provide your API key at your own risk. We strongly recommend using API keys with usage limits and regularly monitoring your OpenAI account for unauthorized activity.

## 8. Website Scraping for Content Ideas

### 8.1 Your Authorization

When you provide a website URL for content idea generation, you represent and warrant that:

- You own or have explicit authorization to scrape and analyze the content of the website you provide.

- The scraping of such website does not violate any applicable law, regulation, or third-party terms of service.

### 8.2 Limitations

We scrape only publicly accessible content from the URLs you provide. We do not access password-protected areas, circumvent technical barriers, or collect personal information from third-party websites. Scraped content is used solely for generating content suggestions during your session and is not permanently stored.
