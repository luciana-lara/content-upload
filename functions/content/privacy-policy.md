In accordance with PIPEDA, we ensure that any third-party service providers processing your personal information outside of Canada provide a comparable level of protection through contractual obligations and appropriate security safeguards.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we rely on standard contractual clauses and other approved transfer mechanisms to ensure your data is adequately protected when transferred outside of these regions.

- **Regular review**: We periodically review and update our security practices.

Despite these measures, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your personal information.
